INSTALLATION:

IMPORTANT: Before you start, we recommend you open readme.txt and follow those instructions. It is faster and easier than these readme_manual.txt instructions. If installation failed using the readme.txt procedure, then continue with these instructions instead.

IMPORTANT: If you use Magento Compiler, disable it. After installation is complete, go to Magento Compiler and run the compilation process.

1. Unzip the contents and upload the app, js and skin folders to your Magento directory.

2. Go to 'System -> Cache Management' and refresh the cache.

3. Configure the Magic Slideshow™ module through the 'Magic Toolbox -> Magic Slideshow™ settings' menu in the Magento admin panel.

4. Magic Slideshow is ready to use!

5. To upgrade your version of Magic Slideshow (which removes the "Please upgrade" text), buy Magic Slideshow and overwrite the skin/frontend/[your_interface]/[your_theme]/js/magicslideshow.js file file with the new one in your licensed version.
